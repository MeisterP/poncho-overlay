poncho-overlay

This is a Gentoo overlay for packages not in the main tree.
The ebuilds are written by myself or copied from other peoples overlays.

The poncho-overlay isn't in laymanâ€™s list of overlays.
To add it manually, append
https://raw.github.com/MeisterP/poncho-overlay/master/poncho-overlay.xml
to the overlays section in /etc/layman/layman.cfg.
