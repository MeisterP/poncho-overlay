 Q: Will Mutter be part of GNOME?
 
-A: It is not officially part of GNOME as of GNOME 2.27. We are hoping to have
-mutter officially included as of GNOME 2.28.
-
-Q: Why does Mutter remember the workspace/position of some apps but not others
-across logout/login?
-
-A: Mutter only stores sizes/positions for apps that are session managed. As far
-as I can determine, there is no way to attempt to remember workspace/position
-for non-session-aware apps without causing a lot of weird effects.
-
-The reason is that you don't know which non-SM-aware apps were launched by the
-session. When you initially log in, Metacity sees a bunch of new windows appear.
-But it can't distinguish between windows that were stored in your session, or
-windows you just launched after logging in. If Metacity tried to guess that a
-window was from the session, it could e.g. end up maximizing a dialog, or put a
-window you just launched on another desktop or in a weird place. And in fact I
-see a lot of bugs like this in window managers that try to handle non-session-
-aware apps.
-
-However, for session-aware apps, Mutter can tell that the application instance
-is from the session and thus restore it reliably, assuming the app properly
-restores the windows it had open on session save. So the correct way to fix the
-situation is to make apps session-aware. libSM has come with X for years, it's
-very standardized, it's shared by GNOME and KDE - even twm is session-aware. So
-anyone who won't take a patch to add SM is more archaic than twm - and you
-should flame them. ;-)

-See also the ICCCM section on SM. For GNOME apps, use the GnomeClient object.
-For a simple example of using libSM directly, twm/session.c in the twm source
-code is pretty easy to understand.

 Q: How about adding viewports in addition to workspaces?
 
-A: I could conceivably be convinced to use viewports _instead_ of workspaces,
-though currently I'm not thinking that. But I don't think it makes any sense to
-have both; it's just confusing. They are functionally equivalent.
-
-You may think this means that you won't have certain keybindings, or something
-like that. This is a misconception. The only _fundamental_ difference between
-viewports and workspaces is that with viewports, windows can "overlap" and
-appear partially on one and partially on another. All other differences that
-traditionally exist in other window managers are accidental - the features
-commonly associated with viewports can be implemented for workspaces, and vice
-versa.
-
-So I don't want to have two kinds of workspace/desktop/viewport/whatever, but
-I'm willing to add features traditionally associated with either kind if those
-features make sense.

 Q: Why is the panel always on top?

-your panel on the bottom" instead of properly supporting fullscreen mode, and
-such).

 Q: Why is there no edge flipping?
 
-A: This one is also in rationales.txt. Because "ouija board" UI, where you just
-move the mouse around and the computer guesses what you mean, has a lot of
-issues. This includes mouse focus, shade-hover mode, edge flipping, autoraise,
-etc. Metacity has mouse focus and autoraise as a compromise, but these features
-are all confusing for many users, and cause problems with accessibility, fitt's
-law, and so on.

 Q: Why does wireframe move/resize suck?
 
 A: You can turn it on with the reduced_resources setting.
 
-But: it has low usability, and is a pain to implement, and there's no reason
-opaque move/resize should be a problem on any setup that can run a modern
-desktop worth a darn to begin with.

-rationale for discussion to an appropriate bugzilla bug, or to

 Q: Your dumb web pages you made me read talk about solving problems in
-fundamental ways instead of adding preferences or workarounds. What are some
-examples where metacity has done this?
+   fundamental ways instead of adding preferences or workarounds.
+   What are some examples where metacity has done this?
 
-A: There are quite a few, though many opportunities remain.  Sometimes the real
-fix involves application changes. The metacity approach is that it's OK to
-require apps to change, though there are also plenty of workarounds in metacity
-for battles considered too hard to fight.

 Q: I think mutter sucks.
 
-A: Feel free to use any WM you like. The reason metacity follows the ICCCM and
-EWMH specifications is that it makes metacity a modular, interchangeable part in
-the desktop. libwnck-based apps such as the GNOME window list will work just
-fine with any EWMH-compliant WM.
